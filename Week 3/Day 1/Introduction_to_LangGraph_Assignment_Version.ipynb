    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

For example if it needs more information based on the query it will choose the appropriate tool to get that information. It knows what tools are available for it to use and the corresponding arguments to correctly call them. The prompt also has instructions on how/when to use the tool in certain situations. The tool itself also has a corresponding description that explain the usage of the tool. The model analyzes the given task or query to identify what kind of operation or information is needed to fulfill the request. Also the model compares the requirements of the task with the capabilities of the available tools. It looks for alignment between what the task needs and what each tool can provide. It can also priotorize which tool to use based on the message history (if any), the relevance, efficiency, and the specificity of the tool to the task at hand."

    "\n",
    "Earlier we used this phrasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

    "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
    "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
    "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
    "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",
    "4. We pass our state object to a \"conditional node\" (more on this later) which reads the last state to determine if we need to use a tool - which it can determine properly because of our provided object!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

       "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, dialogue systems, and other applications requiring access to a large knowledge base.\""

       "   'output': 'LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) are techniques used in the field of machine learning, particularly for fine-tuning large language models. Here’s a brief overview of each and their differences:\\n\\n### LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)\\nLoRA is a method designed to fine-tune large pre-trained models efficiently. Instead of updating all the parameters of the model, LoRA introduces a small number of trainable parameters in the form of low-rank matrices. This significantly reduces the computational cost and memory requirements for fine-tuning. The key idea is to decompose the weight updates into low-rank matrices, which can capture the essential information needed for the adaptation without the need to modify the entire model.\\n\\n### QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)\\nQLoRA builds upon the concept of LoRA by incorporating quantization techniques. Quantization involves reducing the precision of the model parameters (e.g., from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers), which further reduces the memory footprint and computational requirements. QLoRA applies quantization to the low-rank matrices used in LoRA, making the fine-tuning process even more efficient. This allows for the deployment of large models on resource-constrained devices without significant loss in performance.\\n\\n### Key Differences\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**:\\n   - **LoRA**: Introduces low-rank matrices to reduce the number of trainable parameters.\\n   - **QLoRA**: Further reduces the memory and computational requirements by quantizing the low-rank matrices.\\n\\n2. **Memory and Computational Cost**:\\n   - **LoRA**: Reduces the cost compared to full fine-tuning but still uses floating-point precision.\\n   - **QLoRA**: Further reduces the cost by using lower precision (quantized) parameters.\\n\\n3. **Deployment**:\\n   - **LoRA**: Suitable for scenarios where some computational resources are available but full fine-tuning is too expensive.\\n   - **QLoRA**: Ideal for deployment on resource-constrained devices where memory and computational power are limited.\\n\\nIn summary, while both LoRA and QLoRA aim to make the fine-tuning of large models more efficient, QLoRA takes it a step further by incorporating quantization, making it even more suitable for deployment in resource-limited environments.',\n",

       "   'output': \"QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) achieves memory efficiency through a combination of quantization and low-rank adaptation techniques. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Quantization**:\\n   - **Reduced Precision**: QLoRA uses quantization to reduce the precision of the model parameters. Instead of using 32-bit floating-point numbers (FP32), it uses lower precision formats such as 8-bit integers (INT8). This significantly reduces the memory footprint of the model.\\n   - **Storage Efficiency**: By storing weights in a lower precision format, the amount of memory required to store the model parameters is reduced. This allows larger models to fit into the same amount of memory or enables the same model to run on devices with less memory.\\n\\n2. **Low-Rank Adaptation**:\\n   - **Parameter Efficiency**: Low-rank adaptation involves decomposing the weight matrices into products of smaller matrices. This reduces the number of parameters that need to be stored and updated during training.\\n   - **Efficient Updates**: By focusing on the most significant components of the weight matrices, low-rank adaptation allows for efficient updates and reduces the computational overhead during training.\\n\\n3. **Combination of Techniques**:\\n   - **Synergy**: The combination of quantization and low-rank adaptation allows QLoRA to achieve significant memory savings without compromising the model's performance. Quantization reduces the storage requirements, while low-rank adaptation ensures that the most important information is retained and efficiently updated.\\n\\n4. **Practical Implementation**:\\n   - **Hardware Compatibility**: QLoRA is designed to be compatible with modern hardware accelerators that support lower precision arithmetic, such as GPUs and TPUs. This ensures that the memory and computational benefits of QLoRA can be fully realized in practice.\\n\\nBy leveraging these techniques, QLoRA can train and deploy large-scale models more efficiently, making it possible to use advanced models in resource-constrained environments.\",\n",

This technique represents a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing by combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to enhance the quality and relevance of generated text.\n",

      "Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is further trained on a new dataset to adapt it to a specific task. This approach leverages the knowledge the model has already acquired during its initial training on a large dataset, making it more efficient and effective for specialized tasks. Fine-tuning is particularly popular in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Steps in Fine-Tuning:\n",
      "1. **Pre-training**: A model is initially trained on a large, general dataset.\n",
      "2. **Fine-tuning**: The pre-trained model is then trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benefits of Fine-Tuning:\n",
      "- **Efficiency**: Requires less data and computational resources compared to training a model from scratch.\n",
      "- **Performance**: Often results in better performance on the specific task due to the model's prior knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Historical Context:\n",
      "Fine-tuning became particularly prominent with the advent of large pre-trained models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These models demonstrated that fine-tuning could achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks.\n",

      "To find out when fine-tuning specifically broke onto the scene, I can look up relevant information. Would you like me to do that?\n",

      "LLM-based agents, or Large Language Model-based agents, are autonomous systems that leverage large language models to perform tasks, interact with users, and adapt to various inputs and environments. These agents are equipped with capabilities for memory, planning, and execution, allowing them to autonomously perform tasks and respond to user requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of LLM-based agents has been a focal point of research in both academia and industry, leading to a surge in studies exploring their potential. The introduction of these agents can be traced back to the advancements in large language models and their applications in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. The exact timeline of their \"break onto the scene\" is not pinpointed in the search results, but it is closely tied to the development and deployment of advanced language models like GPT-3 and beyond, which gained significant attention around 2020.\n",
