Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, \\nItem 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The \\nCompany assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to \\nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated \\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange \\nCommission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, \\nItem 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor \\nrelations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, \\ninformation on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of \\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this \\nfiling. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:\\n•\\niPad Air®;\\n•\\niPad Pro®;\\n•\\niOS 18, macOS® Sequoia, iPadOS® 18, watchOS® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS® 18.\\nThe Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which will be \\navailable on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, macOS Sequoia and \\niPadOS 18.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is \\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which \\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively.\\nMacroeconomic Conditions\\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and \\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.', doc_id='7c1c4dc5-8470-4263-86b9-88c6e02e2900', wins=4), Node(metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 15, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '10-Q Q3 2024, 06.29.2024-2024-08-01-09-24', 'author': 'anonymous', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 010.001.139', 'creationDate': \"D:20240801162503+00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240801162503+00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='\\nApple Inc. | Q3 2024 Form 10-Q | 13\\n', doc_id='0b1f6be4-3974-4e94-a64f-4ca6a3cfc056'), Node(metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 16, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '10-Q Q3 2024, 06.29.2024-2024-08-01-09-24', 'author': 'anonymous', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 010.001.139', 'creationDate': \"D:20240801162503+00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240801162503+00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='Segment Operating Performance\\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024 and \\nJuly\\xa01, 2023 (dollars in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nNine Months Ended\\nJune 29,\\n2024\\nJuly 1,\\n2023\\nChange\\nJune 29,\\n2024\\nJuly 1,\\n2023\\nChange\\nNet sales by reportable segment:\\nAmericas\\n$ \\n37,678 \\n$ \\n35,383 \\n 6 % $ 125,381 \\n$ 122,445 \\n 2 %\\nEurope\\n \\n21,884 \\n \\n20,205 \\n 8 %  \\n76,404 \\n \\n71,831 \\n 6 %\\nGreater China\\n \\n14,728 \\n \\n15,758 \\n (7) %  \\n51,919 \\n \\n57,475 \\n (10) %\\nJapan\\n \\n5,097 \\n \\n4,821 \\n 6 %  \\n19,126 \\n \\n18,752 \\n 2 %\\nRest of Asia Pacific\\n \\n6,390 \\n \\n5,630 \\n 13 %  \\n23,275 \\n \\n23,284 \\n — %\\nTotal net sales\\n$ \\n85,777 \\n$ \\n81,797 \\n 5 % $ 296,105 \\n$ 293,787 \\n 1 %\\nAmericas\\nAmericas net sales increased during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to higher net \\nsales of Services and iPad.

The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article \\n5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed \\nthrough the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, \\nwhich relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the \\nCommission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are \\nin breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the \\nCompany’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the \\nCommission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose \\nfines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the \\nGeneral Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, \\nunless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes \\nto its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil \\nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or \\nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. \\nThe DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters \\nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary \\ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend \\nitself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District \\nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based \\nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App \\nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \\nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \\n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and \\nintends to vigorously defend itself.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in \\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is \\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above \\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially \\nadversely affected.\\nItem 1A. \\nRisk Factors\\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \\nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, \\nItem 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter', doc_id='83db4bf1-8719-4c06-b6b2-d7c9a629df60', wins=4), Node(metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 21, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '10-Q Q3 2024, 06.29.2024-2024-08-01-09-24', 'author': 'anonymous', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 010.001.139', 'creationDate': \"D:20240801162503+00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240801162503+00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=' ended March 30, 2024 (the “second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q”), in each case under the \\nheading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, \\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover \\nadditional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of \\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the \\nState Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, \\nthe General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court’s \\ndecision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is \\nexpected in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion \\nof any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.\\nNote 7 – Debt\\nCommercial Paper\\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

Forward-looking \\nstatements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does \\nnot directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future \\nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. \\nForward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” \\n“intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not \\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the \\nforward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, \\nItem 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The \\nCompany assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to \\nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated \\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange \\nCommission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, \\nItem 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor \\nrelations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, \\ninformation on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of \\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this \\nfiling. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:\\n•\\niPad Air®;\\n•\\niPad Pro®;\\n•\\niOS 18, macOS® Sequoia, iPadOS® 18, watchOS® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS® 18.\\nThe Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which will be \\navailable on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices.

The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article \\n5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed \\nthrough the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, \\nwhich relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the \\nCommission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are \\nin breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the \\nCompany’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the \\nCommission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose \\nfines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the \\nGeneral Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, \\nunless a stay of the order is granted.

In addition, various civil litigation matters \\nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary \\ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend \\nitself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District \\nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based \\nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App \\nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \\nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \\n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court.

An additional week is \\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which \\noccurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. \\nUnless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended \\nin September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nNote 2 – Revenue\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024 and \\nJuly\\xa01, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nNine Months Ended\\nJune 29,\\n2024\\nJuly 1,\\n2023\\nJune 29,\\n2024\\nJuly 1,\\n2023\\niPhone®\\n$ \\n39,296 \\n$ \\n39,669 \\n$ \\n154,961 \\n$ \\n156,778 \\nMac®\\n \\n7,009 \\n \\n6,840 \\n \\n22,240 \\n \\n21,743 \\niPad®\\n \\n7,162 \\n \\n5,791 \\n \\n19,744 \\n \\n21,857 \\nWearables, Home and Accessories\\n \\n8,097 \\n \\n8,284 \\n \\n27,963 \\n \\n30,523 \\nServices\\n \\n24,213 \\n \\n21,213 \\n \\n71,197 \\n \\n62,886 \\nTotal net sales\\n$ \\n85,777 \\n$ \\n81,797 \\n$ \\n296,105 \\n$ \\n293,787 \\nTotal net sales include $3.4 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended June\\xa029, 2024 that was included in deferred \\nrevenue as of March\\xa030, 2024, $3.3 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended July\\xa01, 2023 that was included in \\ndeferred revenue as of April\\xa0 1, 2023, $6.5 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended June\\xa0 29, 2024 that was \\nincluded in deferred revenue as of September\\xa030, 2023, and $7.0 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended July\\xa01, \\n2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa024, 2022.\\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment \\nin Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024 and July\\xa01, \\n2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\\nAs of June\\xa0 29, 2024 and September\\xa0 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.1\\xa0 billion, \\nrespectively.

Forward-looking \\nstatements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does \\nnot directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future \\nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. \\nForward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” \\n“intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not \\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the \\nforward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, \\nItem 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The \\nCompany assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to \\nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated \\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange \\nCommission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, \\nItem 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor \\nrelations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, \\ninformation on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of \\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this \\nfiling. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:\\n•\\niPad Air®;\\n•\\niPad Pro®;\\n•\\niOS 18, macOS® Sequoia, iPadOS® 18, watchOS® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS® 18.\\nThe Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which will be \\navailable on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices.

(“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District \\nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based \\nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App \\nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \\nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \\n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and \\nintends to vigorously defend itself.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in \\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is \\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above \\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially \\nadversely affected.\\nItem 1A. \\nRisk Factors\\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \\nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, \\nItem 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter', doc_id='83db4bf1-8719-4c06-b6b2-d7c9a629df60', wins=4), Node(metadata={'source': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_earnings/2024/q3/filing/_10-Q-Q3-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 21, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '10-Q Q3 2024, 06.29.2024-2024-08-01-09-24', 'author': 'anonymous', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 010.001.139', 'creationDate': \"D:20240801162503+00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240801162503+00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=' ended March 30, 2024 (the “second quarter 2024 Form 10-Q”), in each case under the \\nheading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, \\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

An additional week is \\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which \\noccurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. \\nUnless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended \\nin September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nNote 2 – Revenue\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024 and \\nJuly\\xa01, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nNine Months Ended\\nJune 29,\\n2024\\nJuly 1,\\n2023\\nJune 29,\\n2024\\nJuly 1,\\n2023\\niPhone®\\n$ \\n39,296 \\n$ \\n39,669 \\n$ \\n154,961 \\n$ \\n156,778 \\nMac®\\n \\n7,009 \\n \\n6,840 \\n \\n22,240 \\n \\n21,743 \\niPad®\\n \\n7,162 \\n \\n5,791 \\n \\n19,744 \\n \\n21,857 \\nWearables, Home and Accessories\\n \\n8,097 \\n \\n8,284 \\n \\n27,963 \\n \\n30,523 \\nServices\\n \\n24,213 \\n \\n21,213 \\n \\n71,197 \\n \\n62,886 \\nTotal net sales\\n$ \\n85,777 \\n$ \\n81,797 \\n$ \\n296,105 \\n$ \\n293,787 \\nTotal net sales include $3.4 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended June\\xa029, 2024 that was included in deferred \\nrevenue as of March\\xa030, 2024, $3.3 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended July\\xa01, 2023 that was included in \\ndeferred revenue as of April\\xa0 1, 2023, $6.5 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended June\\xa0 29, 2024 that was \\nincluded in deferred revenue as of September\\xa030, 2023, and $7.0 billion of revenue recognized in the nine months ended July\\xa01, \\n2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa024, 2022.\\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment \\nin Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 29, 2024 and July\\xa01, \\n2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\\nAs of June\\xa0 29, 2024 and September\\xa0 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.1\\xa0 billion, \\nrespectively.

Forward-looking \\nstatements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does \\nnot directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future \\nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. \\nForward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” \\n“intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not \\nguarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the \\nforward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, \\nItem 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The \\nCompany assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to \\nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated \\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange \\nCommission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, \\nItem 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor \\nrelations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, \\ninformation on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of \\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this \\nfiling. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:\\n•\\niPad Air®;\\n•\\niPad Pro®;\\n•\\niOS 18, macOS® Sequoia, iPadOS® 18, watchOS® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS® 18.\\nThe Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which will be \\navailable on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, macOS Sequoia and \\niPadOS 18.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is \\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which \\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023.

The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article \\n5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed \\nthrough the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, \\nwhich relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the \\nCommission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are \\nin breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the \\nCompany’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the \\nCommission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose \\nfines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the \\nGeneral Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, \\nunless a stay of the order is granted.

In addition, various civil litigation matters \\nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary \\ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend \\nitself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District \\nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based \\nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App \\nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \\nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \\n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court.
