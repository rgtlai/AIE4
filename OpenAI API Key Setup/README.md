# Creating a Project API Key in OpenAI

To use OpenAI's API throughout this bootcamp - please ensure you follow their new API Key process:

1. Select the organisation where you want to create your new project. If you don't have any organisation set-up, the "Personal" organisation is selected by default. You can use it.

2. Create a new project, and name it "aim" or "aie3" (technically the name doesn't matter - but for ease of tracking it's likely good to use something to indicates this is a project for this course).

8. Verify credit and payment method. These are specific to each organisation. Make sure that you have some credit available and a payment method associated to the organisation in which your project and API key belong to.
