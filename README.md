# 🧑‍💻 What is [AI Engineering](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/ai-eng-bootcamp)?

AI Engineering refers to the industry-relevant skills that data science and engineering teams need to successfully **build, deploy, operate, and improve Large Language Model (LLM) applications in production environments**.  

In practice, this requires understanding both prototyping and production deployments.

During the *prototyping* phase, Prompt Engineering, [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrSHiQgy4VjFlWgcLHatJCBgfeE8smVyP), and [Fine-Tuning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrSHiQgy4VjGMzyXsSlvN-TjPaqFFsAGP) are all necessary tools to be able to understand and leverage. Prototyping includes:
- Building RAG Applications
- Fine-Tuning LLMs & Embedding Models
- Building Agent/Reasoning Applications
- LLM Application Deployment

When *productionizing* LLM application prototypes, there are many important aspects ensuring helpful, harmless, honest, reliable, and scalable solutions for your customers or stakeholders. Productionizing includes:
- RAG Evaluation and Improvement
- Monitoring and Visibility Tooling
- Efficient Inference and Serving
- Scaling LLM Applications

This bootcamp builds on our two previous courses, [LLM Engineering](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/llm-engineering) and [LLM Operations](https://maven.com/aimakerspace/llmops) 👇

- Large Language Model Engineering (LLM Engineering) refers to the emerging best practices and tools for training, fine-tuning, and aligning LLMs before production deployment.  LLM Engineering is the counterpart to ML Engineering (MLE) which focuses on LLM-specific techniques like prompt engineering, reinforcement learning, quantization, and other methods required by this new paradigm.
    
- Large Language Model Ops (LLM Ops, or LLMOps (as from [WandB](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/prompts) and [a16z](https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications/))) refers to the emerging best-practices, tooling, and improvement processes used to manage production LLM applications throughout the AI product lifecycle.  LLM Ops is a subset of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) that focuses on LLM-specific infrastructure and ops capabilities required to build, deploy, monitor, and scale complex LLM applications in production environments.

# 🏆 **Grading and Certification**

To become **AI-Makerspace Certified**, which will open you up to additional opportunities for full and part-time work within our community and network, you must:

1. Complete all project assignments.
2. Complete a project and present during Demo Day.
3. Receive at least an 85% total grade in the course.

If you do not complete all assignments, participate in Demo Day, or maintain a high-quality standard of work, you may still be eligible for a *certificate of completion* if you miss no more than 2 live sessions.
