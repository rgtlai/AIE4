            "### 1. For Loop\n",

            "# Example of a for loop\n",

            "    print(i)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. While Loop\n",
            "The `while` loop continues until a specified condition is no longer `True`.\n",
            "\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Looping through collections\n",
            "If you want to iterate through a collection like a list or dictionary, using a `for` loop can be quite elegant.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Looping through a list:\n",
