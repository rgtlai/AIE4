            "### For Loop\n",
            "\n",
            "A `for` loop is often the most Pythonic way to iterate over a collection, like a list, tuple, or dictionary. Here's a basic example for iterating over a list:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
            "for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "    print(fruit)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### While Loop\n",
            "\n",
            "A `while` loop is useful when the number of iterations isn't known beforehand and you want to continue looping until a certain condition is met. For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "count = 0\n",
            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(count)\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Best Practices\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Keep It Simple**: Try to keep your loops straightforward and easy to understand.\n",
            " \n",
            "2. **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Always ensure there's a condition that allows the loop to terminate, especially with `while` loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Use List Comprehensions**: When you want to create a new list by transforming elements from an existing list, a list comprehension is often a cleaner and more efficient way to do it:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Utilize `enumerate`**: If you need both the index and the value from a list, consider using `enumerate`:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
            "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Iterate Over Dictionaries with Care**: If you're looping over a dictionary, you can directly iterate over keys, but you can also use `.items()` for key-value pairs:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n",
            "for key, value in person.items():\n",
            "    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Break and Continue**: Use the `break` statement to exit a loop early, and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Example Combining Ideas\n",
            "\n",
            "Here’s a small example that combines some of these best practices:\n",
            "\n",
