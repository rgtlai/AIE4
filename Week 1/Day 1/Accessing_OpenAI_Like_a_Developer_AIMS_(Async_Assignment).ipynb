He will arrive instantly.\n- After that, he will need to take a bus, which will take 1 hour. This means he will arrive at his destination at 1PM local time + 1 hour = 2PM local time.\n\nComparing the two options, it is clear that the Teleporter + Bus option is faster. Billy will arrive at his destination at 2PM local time, which is well before 7PM EDT.

Using this criterion, Mount Everest in the Himalayas is considered the tallest mountain on Earth, with its peak soaring to 29,032 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. \n\nAnother way to consider the tallest mountain is by measuring its height from base to summit. By this measure, Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the tallest mountain, with a total height of over 33,500 feet (10,210 meters) from its base on the seafloor to its summit above sea level.\n\nSo, if we define \"tall\" based on elevation above sea level, Mount Everest is the tallest mountain.
